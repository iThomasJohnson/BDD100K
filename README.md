# XLMMacroDeobfuscator
XLMMacroDeobfuscator can be used to decode obfuscated XLM macros (also known as Excel 4.0 macros). It utilizes an internal XLM emulator to interpret the macros, without fully performing the code.

Currenly, it only supports xlsm format. XLS format will be added soon.

# Running the script
To run the script 

```
python  XLMMacroDeobfuscator.py --file document.xlsm
```

* This code is heavyly under development. Expect to see radical changes in the code.
